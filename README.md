FastAPI for processing IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) using IfcOpenShell.

## Documentation

📚 Read the full documentation at [louistrue.github.io/openBIM-service](https://louistrue.github.io/openBIM-service/)

## Features

- 🔍 IFC file processing with IfcOpenShell
- 📊 Extract building element properties and quantities
- 🏢 Split IFC files by storey
- 📏 Automatic unit conversion
- 🏗️ Building element information including:
  - Geometry (volume, area, dimensions)
  - Materials and their volumes
  - Properties (loadBearing, isExternal)
  - Building storey assignment
- Process geometry
- Async processing with callback support

## Data Privacy & Security

We take data privacy seriously:

- 🗑️ All uploaded files are automatically deleted after processing is complete
- 🧹 Temporary files are completely wiped from container storage every hour
- 🔒 Files are processed with minimal disk persistence
- 📝 Processing logs are kept only for debugging and are regularly purged
- 🔐 All API requests require authentication via API key

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- pip

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
.\venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # For development
```

4. Set up your API key:

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

This API key is required for all API requests and tests.

## Development

Start the development server:

```bash
python run.py
```

The API will be available at http://localhost:8000

## Testing

Run tests using pytest:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=app tests/

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_endpoints.py
```

Test outputs are saved in `tests/output/` directory, including:

- Process results in JSONL format
- Error responses in JSON format

## Callback Functionality

The `/api/ifc/extract-building-elements` endpoint supports asynchronous processing with callbacks. When using callbacks:

1. The endpoint returns immediately with a task ID
2. Progress updates (10%) are sent to the callback URL
3. Final results are sent to the callback URL
4. All callback requests include the provided token in Authorization header

### Callback Data Format

Progress updates:

```json
{
  "status": "processing",
  "progress": 10,
  "total_elements": 100,
  "processed_elements": 10
}
```

Final result:

```json
{
    "status": "completed",
    "progress": 100,
    "result": {
        "metadata": { ... },
        "elements": [ ... ]
    }
}
```

Error case:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": "Error message"
}
```

### Testing Callbacks

1. Start the callback test server:

```bash
python tests/callback_server.py
```

2. In another terminal, run the test script:

```bash
python tests/test_callback.py
```

The callback server will log all received callbacks, including progress updates and the final result.
